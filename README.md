Swipe Them
==========

Swipe the tiles in the direction of the arrows. You have only 60 seconds!

# How to Play

* You will get one point for each tile swiped correctly
* Making the wrong gesture will reduce a point
* Touching the mines (tiles with vertical and horizontal lines) will reduce a point
* If you don't swipe a tile in less than 5 seconds it will explode and reduce a point

# Configuration
